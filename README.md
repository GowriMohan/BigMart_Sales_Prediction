# Big Mart Sales Prediction

Attempted big mart sales practice problem contest in Analytics Vidhya where I used a regression approach of machine learning to predict the sales. 

The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and predict the sales of each product at a particular outlet.
• There is Test, Train and submission file available. 
• The Train file is for training the model and for model evaluation and test file is only for making predictions.
• Test file will not be having the output column.  
• Did EDA and pre-processing separately on the train and test dataset.
• After getting the best model, uploaded the sample submission file to python.
• Replaced the ‘Item_Outlet_Sales’ column with the prediction values that I got using the test dataset for the best model.
• Saved this new dataset as a csv file and uploaded this dataset in the Solution Checker in Analytics Vidhya

The solution is divided into the following sections:

1. Data understanding and exploration (EDA)

2. Data Preprocessing

3. Model building and evaluation

4. Predictions.
