Big Mart Sales Prediction-Analytics Vidhya
‚óè	Attempted big mart sales practice problem contest in Analytics Vidhya where I used a regression approach of machine  learning to predict the sales. 

The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and predict the sales of each product at a particular outlet.

The solution is divided into the following sections:

1. Data understanding and exploration (EDA)

2. Data Preprocessing

3. Model building and evaluation

4. Predictions.
